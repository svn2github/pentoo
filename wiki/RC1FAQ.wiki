=Q.) I installed with unetbootin and I got a password prompt at boot=

A.) Unetbootin seems to force start xdm somehow, honestly we aren't even sure how this happens yet.  use ctrl+alt+f1 to get back to console 1 and "/etc/init.d/xdm stop" to kill that random xdm that isn't needed. As noted in the motd you can start x with "startx"

== Q.) I tried to upgrade but I got this error: ==
(x11-base/xorg-server-1.13.1::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge) conflicts with <x11-base/xorg-server-1.12.99 required by (x11-drivers/xf86-video-neomagic-1.2.7::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge)

A.) You can safely edit "/etc/portage/make.conf" and remove neomagic from the VIDEO_CARDS= section.  While you are there, you can remove all the other video cards you don't use.  It is suggested to keep VIDEO_CARDS="vesa vga fbdev" plus whatever your video card is. "emerge -vp xorg-drivers" will show you all the available options.

== Q.) I tried to install {nvidia,ati}-drivers but it couldn't download the files. ==

A.) If you can connect to the internet, this is a fine solution.  If you have no network connection you can find the needed files were accidently dumped into / so just move the tar.gz, .zip, and .run files into /usr/portage/distfiles and the install can proceed without network.

== Q.) How to start armitage? ==

    Answer "yes" to start RPC msf server
