#summary Use the power of Pentoo with your existing Gentoo setup

= Introduction =

Pentoo Linux can be used as an overlay bringing a full set of tools and settings to an existing stable Gentoo setup.

= Adding the overlay =

{{{
# Update the portage to the latest version
emerge --sync

# Make sure that layman with the "subversion" flag is installed
USE="subversion" emerge app-portage/layman

# Update list of overlays
layman -L

# Add Pentoo overlay
layman -a pentoo

# List of available profiles
eselect profile list

# Select an appropriate Pentoo profile for your current setup
eselect profile set pentoo:pentoo/hardened/linux/amd64

# Check what has changed and adjust other settings if required
# See the next section for examples
emerge -DNupv world

# Install the entire Pentoo 
emerge -DNu pentoo
# or choose a separate package
emerge -DNu pentoo-wireless
}}}

= Adjusting settings =

Settings can be changed in a usual Gentoo way by changing _package.keywords_ or _package.use_ files/directories. For example, you can disable additional wireless drivers by adding a file to the  /etc/portage/package.use/ directory with the following content:
{{{
pentoo/pentoo-wireless -drivers
}}}

= Updating overlay =
The updating procedure is the same as described in the [PentooUpdater#On regular basis Pentoo Updater] section
