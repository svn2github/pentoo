#summary Use the power of Pentoo with your existing Gentoo setup

= Introduction =

Pentoo Linux can be used as an overlay bringing a full set of tools and settings to an existing stable Gentoo setup.

= Adding the overlay =

{{{
# Update the portage to the latest version
emerge --sync

# Make sure that layman with the "subversion" flag is installed
USE="subversion" emerge app-portage/layman

# Update list of overlays
layman -L

# Add Pentoo overlay
layman -a pentoo

# List of available profiles
eselect profile list

# Select an appropriate Pentoo profile for your current setup
eselect profile set pentoo:pentoo/hardened/linux/amd64

# Check what has changed and adjust other settings if required
# See the next section for examples
emerge -DNupv world

# Alternatively, create symlinks for necessarily keywords/use files:
ln -s /var/lib/layman/pentoo/profiles/pentoo/base/package.accept_keywords/net-analyzer /etc/portage/package.keywords
ln -s /var/lib/layman/pentoo/profiles/pentoo/base/package.use/dev-ruby /etc/portage/package.use

# Install the entire Pentoo 
emerge -DNu pentoo
# or choose a separate package
emerge -DNu pentoo-wireless
}}}

= Adjusting settings =

To merge the overlay with your current setup smoother, additional changes can be made in a usual Gentoo way by modifying files in the /etc/portage directory. For example, you can disable additional wireless drivers by adding a file to the  /etc/portage/package.use/ directory with the following content:
{{{
pentoo/pentoo-wireless -drivers
}}}
and disable unrequired global flags in the make.conf file:
{{{
USE="-gps -caps -livecd -ldap"
}}}
See the official [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo handbook] for more details
= Updating the overlay =
The updating procedure is the same as described in the [PentooUpdater#On_regular_basis Pentoo Updater] section

= Removing the overlay =

Uninstall whatever was installed
{{{
emerge -C pentoo
# or a separate package
emerge -C pentoo-wireless
}}}

If you installed multiple individual packages, use the following command to get the list:
<code language="sh">cd /var/db/pkg ; for x in */* ; do [[ -f "${x}/repository" ]] && echo ${x} `cat ${x}/repository` ; done | grep pentoo</code>

Clean up the system and remove the overlay from your repository:
{{{
emerge --depclean
eclean-dist
revdep-rebuild
layman -d pentoo
}}}
