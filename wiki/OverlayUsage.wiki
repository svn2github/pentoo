#summary Use power of Pentoo with your existing Gentoo setup

= Introduction =

Pentoo Linux can be used as an overlay bringing a full set of tools and settings to an existing stable Gentoo setup.

= Adding the overlay =

{{{
# Update the portage to the latest version
emerge --sync

# Make sure that layman with the "subversion" flag is installed
USE="subversion" emerge app-portage/layman

# Update list of overlays
layman -S

# Add Pentoo overlay
layman -a pentoo

# List of available profiles
eselect profile list

# Select an appropriate Pentoo profile for your current setup
eselect profile set pentoo:pentoo/hardened/linux/amd64

# Check what has changed and adjust other settings if required
# See the next section for examples
emerge -DNupv world

# Install the entire Pentoo or choose a separate package
emerge -DNupv pentoo
}}}

= Adjusting settings =

Settings can be changed in a usual Gentoo way by changing _package.keywords_ or _package.use_ files. For example, /etc/portage/package.use/
{{{
net-wireless/compat-wireless -drivers
}}}

= Updating overlay =
The updating procedure is the same as described in the [PentooUpdater Pentoo Updater#On regular basis] section
