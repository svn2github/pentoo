#summary UEFI booting with Pentoo

= Introduction =

This article covers basic information about UEFI booting and the steps to use boot Pentoo through UEFI.<br/>
It's currently based on the Pentoo 2012.0 Beta3 Release - we are working on it, this will one day be part of the installer ;)

_Note: This section is currently under construction!_


= USB Stick Installation =

Install Pentoo to an USB stick using unetbootin and the iso image.<br/>
The stick should have an msdos partition layout and one fat32 partition with the boot flag.<br/>
Prepare the stick as in [UEFI_2_Preparation], the kernel modification is highly recommended.<br/>
Install a BootX64.efi using either [UEFI_6_Grub2Image] or [UEFI_7_Grub2Standalone].<br/>
Optional: Install the EFI shell as described in [UEFI_3_EfiShell].<br/>
That's all - _use the provided downloads in the articles!_


= Hard Disk Installation =

UEFI booting requires an UEFI boot partition - a fat32 partition with the boot flag as first partition of the disk.<br/>
Install Pentoo using the pentoo-installer, [UEFI_4_PentooInstaller] covers an installation to a GPT partition layout.<br/>
Boot through UEFI *at least one time* using one of the methods in [UEFI_3_EfiShell], [UEFI_6_Grub2Image] or [UEFI_7_Grub2Standalone].<br/>
Then see [UEFI_5_BootKernelDirectly] to permanently add the kernel as new UEFI boot option.<br/>

= TODO: =

  * Add info for ISO generation with xorriso instead of mkisofs.
  * Quick how-to hardcode boot params into kernel

Enjoy ;)
