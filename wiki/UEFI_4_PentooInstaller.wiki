#summary UEFI: pentoo-installer guide for UEFI and GPT

= Introduction =

This article covers a Pentoo installation to hard disk using the pentoo-installer.<br/>
It shows how to install to a GPT partition layout and make the installation UEFI-bootable.


= Pentoo-Installer =

Update the pentoo-installer with:
{{{
eix-sync
emerge -avt pentoo-installer
}}}

Run the pentoo-installer, configure everything as usual with these modifications:
  * Chose to manually configure hard disk.
  * Select "gpt" as Partition Table
  * Create the following partitions:

|| # || FS || Size || mount point || name ||
|| /dev/sda1 || vfat || 256M || /boot/efi || UEFI ||
|| /dev/sda2 || ext2 || 64M || /boot || BOOT ||
|| /dev/sda3 || swap || 4G ||  || SWAP ||
|| /dev/sda4 || ext4 || 16G || / || ROOT ||


== Booting GRUB-2 through UEFI ==

  * On "4. Install Bootloader" choose "UEFI-GRUB".
  * The UEFI boot partition will be /dev/sda1.
  * The GRUB device path will be (hd0,2) - the default, /dev/sda2 where the kernel resides.


== Booting kernel directly through UEFI ==

UEFI can boot the kernel directly, but to add them with efibootmgr, the kernel needs to be booted through UEFI.<br/>
Use one of the methods described in [UEFI_3_EfiShell], [UEFI_6_Grub2Image] or [UEFI_7_Grub2Standalone] to boot an USB stick through UEFI.<br/>

Then run the pentoo-installer and:
  * On "4. Install Bootloader" choose "UEFI".
  * The kernel partition (/boot) will be /dev/sda2 with the above partition layout.
