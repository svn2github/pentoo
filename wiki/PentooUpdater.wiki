To eliminate most of the question in IRC (#pentoo) and to start a good documentation process, here are the steps to bring your system up to date.

WARNING: The errors on your screen need to be read and acted upon, following these directions blindly will result in failure, then ridicule, then more failure.

== For the first time ==

{{{
# Sync with the portage tree
emerge --sync

# Modify /etc/portage/make.conf file for your system:
ACCEPT_LICENSE="Oracle-BCLA-JavaSE AdobeFlash-10.3"
# You may wish to edit your VIDEO_CARDS line as well but only if you know what you are doing.
# Example for nvidia users:
VIDEO_CARDS="nvidia fbdev vga vesa"

# Modify your profile only if you know what you are doing, default should be fine for most users
eselect profile list
eselect profile set <number>

# Update everything for the first time
emerge --deep --update --newuse world -vat

# Check live packages for updates and emerge them as necessary.
smart-live-rebuild

# Check and rebuild broken packages after upgrade
revdep-rebuild

# Update any needed configuration files
etc-update

}}}

== On regular basis ==

{{{
# This will become the pentoo-updater script soon

emerge --sync
