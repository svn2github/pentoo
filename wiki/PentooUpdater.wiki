= Update Commands =

To eliminate most of the question in IRC (#pentoo) and to start a good documentation process, here are the steps to bring your system up to date.

WARNING: The errors on your screen need to be read and acted upon, following these directions blindly will result in failure, then ridicule, then more failure.

== For the first time ==

{{{
# Sync with the portage tree
emerge --sync

# Modify /etc/portage/make.conf file for your system:
ACCEPT_LICENSE="Oracle-BCLA-JavaSE AdobeFlash-10.3"
# You may wish to edit your VIDEO_CARDS line as well but only if you know what you are doing.
# Example for nvidia users:
VIDEO_CARDS="nvidia fbdev vga vesa"

# Modify your profile only if you know what you are doing, default should be fine for most users
eselect profile list
eselect profile set <number>

Follow the pentoo-updater below
}}}

== On regular basis ==

{{{
# This will become the pentoo-updater script soon

#This syncs the gentoo and pentoo repos like "apt-get update" in debian
emerge --sync
#This updates all the normal packages like "apt-get upgrade" in debian
emerge --deep --update --newuse world -vt
#this optionally merges in changed config files. unchanged files are merged automatically
etc-update
#this removes old packages which are not needed like "apt-get autoremove" in debian
emerge --depclean
#this rebuilds anything which may have been broken in update
emerge @preserved-rebuild
#this checks all the programs installed from VCS for new revisions and updates if needed
smart-live-rebuild
#verifies there is no breakage after updates
revdep-rebuild
# Regenerate the main menu for XFCE WM
genmenu.py -x
#merge in any new config files
etc-update
#clean up the distfiles dir to remove old/un-needed files
eclean-dist -d
