= Update Commands =

To eliminate most of the question in IRC (#pentoo) and to start a good documentation process, here are the steps to bring your system up to date.

WARNING: The errors on your screen need to be read and acted upon, following these directions blindly will result in failure, then ridicule, then more failure.

== For the first time ==

{{{
# Sync with the portage tree
emerge --sync

# Modify /etc/portage/make.conf file for your system:
ACCEPT_LICENSE="Oracle-BCLA-JavaSE AdobeFlash-10.3"
# You may wish to edit your VIDEO_CARDS line to match your system better.
# Example for nvidia users:
VIDEO_CARDS="nvidia fbdev vga vesa"
# Guest OS users should add virtualbox/vmware or qxl flag(s):
VIDEO_CARDS="virtualbox fbdev vga vesa"

# Modify your profile only if you know what you are doing, default should be fine for most users
eselect profile list
eselect profile set <number>

Follow the pentoo-updater below
}}}

== On regular basis ==

Pay extra attention on upgrading [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/kernel-upgrade.xml kernel], [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gcc-upgrading.xml gcc]. It is important to upgrade these packages properly before moving to the next step.

{{{
# This will become the pentoo-updater script soon

# This syncs the gentoo and pentoo repos like "apt-get update" in debian
emerge --sync
# This updates all the normal packages like "apt-get upgrade" in debian
emerge --deep --update --newuse world -vt
# This optionally merges in changed config files. unchanged files are merged automatically
etc-update
# This removes old packages which are not needed like "apt-get autoremove" in debian
emerge --depclean
# This rebuilds anything which may have been broken in update
emerge @preserved-rebuild
# This checks all the programs installed from VCS for new revisions and updates if needed
smart-live-rebuild
# Verifies there is no breakage after updates
revdep-rebuild
# Regenerate the main menu for XFCE WM (run it under each regular account)
genmenu.py -x
#merge in any new config files
etc-update
#clean up the distfiles dir to remove old/un-needed files
eclean-dist -d
# Check /var/log/portage/elog/summary.log file
# You might need to run extra commands. For example:
emerge @x11-module-rebuild
eselect java-vm set system icedtea-bin-7
