#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

We need a set of rules to govern our behavior. This wiki page is intended to be a place to compile such policies in one place.


= USE flags: =

*pentoo* is used to switch on and off our changes to packages we are overriding for gentoo.  For instance we have acpid in our repo, and the diffs from gentoo are controlled with the *pentoo* use flag.
*livecd* is used for things which belong on the livecd but not on the installed systems
*!livecd* is used for things which belong on the running systems but not on the livecd (do not abuse this for large packages)
_missing_ we need a new use flag to denote the difference between livecd sized versions and maxi versions.  *maxi* is possible and not currently in use, thoughts?

= Keywording: =

Any packages we are overriding from gentoo MUST keep the same keywords as gentoo at all times (do the best you can). Remember when overriding gentoo packages you MUST use the *pentoo* use flag for all changes.  You can always update portage/profiles/package.accept_keywords to install the version you want.

Any packages that are ONLY in pentoo can be keyworded as you please.  If you have tested it on an arch then feel free to add that keyword.  If you think it is stable, then feel free to keyword it as such.

= Additions: =

Please feel free to add to this list of rules and policies as you see fit.  Discussion can take place on irc or the dev mailing list.
