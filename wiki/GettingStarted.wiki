#summary A quick guide to getting started with Pentoo project.

= Getting Started =

*Pentoo is a security-focused livecd based on Gentoo*

(...)it's basically a Gentoo, a highly customizable Linux-based operating system and a meta-distribution. Using excellent development techniques, we have created a pre-configured security-focused or so called penetration testing LiveCD distribution that is built automatically from source code and is customized with the functionality that you want to have and without the unnecessary features that you want to avoid, with lots of customized tools, customized kernel, and much more. Pentoo Linux features an overlay and [Pentoo profiles]. "Overlays" are package trees for Portage. They contain additional ebuilds for Gentoo. Portage profiles specify default values for global and per-package USE flags and most variables of the /etc/portage/make.conf and define a set of system packages. Also it masks unstable package versions and USE flags. These techniques allow us to maintain capabilities of building a Linux-based operating system which inheriting all the Pentoo LiveCD goods and is a rolling release distribution which is essentially version-less once installed.

== Features ==

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the features currently included :

 * Hardened Kernel with aufs patches
 * Backported Wifi stack from latest stable kernel release
 * Module loading support ala slax
 * Changes saving on usb stick
 * XFCE4 wm
 * Cuda/OPENCL cracking support with development tools
 * System updates if you got it finally installed


===Pentoo profiles and overlay===
Put simply, Pentoo is Gentoo with the pentoo overlay. This overlay is available in layman so all you have to do is 
{{{
 layman -L and layman -a pentoo.
}}}
Among other ebuilds we have a pentoo/pentoo meta ebuild too. A meta ebuild is a ebuild that doesn't install files by itself, but instead it's used to install a group of other ebuilds with one command. It accomplishes this by having all this other ebuilds as dependencies.

We have multiple pentoo profiles, which will install all the pentoo tools based on USE flags.

== Download ==

DownloadPentoo page.

== Installation ==

Pentoo is a security-focused livecd, is a complete bootable  installation including operating system which runs in a computer's memory, rather than loading from a hard disk drive. The functionality of a livecd is also available with a bootable live USB flash drive, or even an external USB drive.

The Pentoo dev-team also provides methods of installation on a local hard drive:
 * Pentoo can be installed directly from the livecd using our installer PentooInstaller
 * Pentoo can be installed using overlay OverlayUsage

== Update ==

== Who is behind it ==
