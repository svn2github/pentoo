== Features ==

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the features currently included :

 * Hardened Kernel with aufs patches
 * Backported Wifi stack from latest stable kernel release
 * Module loading support ala slax
 * Changes saving on usb stick
 * XFCE4 wm
 * Cuda/OPENCL cracking support with development tools
 * System updates if you got it finally installed
Put simply, Pentoo is Gentoo with the pentoo overlay. This overlay is available in layman so all you have to do is layman -L and layman -a pentoo.

We have a pentoo/pentoo meta ebuild and multiple pentoo profiles, which will install all the pentoo tools based on USE flags.

== Who is behind it ==

The Pentoo dev team consist of a few core developers and a many random acts of kindness from others. Of course, we are all big Gentoo fans
