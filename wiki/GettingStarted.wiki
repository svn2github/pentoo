#summary A quick guide to getting started with Pentoo project.

= Getting Started =

*Pentoo is a security-focused livecd based on Gentoo*

it's basically a Gentoo, a Linux-based operating system and a meta-distribution, which means that it is built automatically from source code and is customized with the functionality that you want to have and without the unnecessary features that you want to avoid, with lots of customized tools, customized kernel, and much more...

== Features ==

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the features currently included :

 * Hardened Kernel with aufs patches
 * Backported Wifi stack from latest stable kernel release
 * Module loading support ala slax
 * Changes saving on usb stick
 * XFCE4 wm
 * Cuda/OPENCL cracking support with development tools
 * System updates if you got it finally installed
Put simply, Pentoo is Gentoo with the pentoo overlay. This overlay is available in layman so all you have to do is layman -L and layman -a pentoo.

We have a pentoo/pentoo meta ebuild and multiple pentoo profiles, which will install all the pentoo tools based on USE flags.

== Download ==

DownloadPentoo page.

== Installation ==

Pentoo is a security-focused livecd, is a complete bootable  installation including operating system which runs in a computer's memory, rather than loading from a hard disk drive. The functionality of a livecd is also available with a bootable live USB flash drive, or even an external USB drive.

The Pentoo dev-team also provides methods of installation on a local hard drive:
 * Pentoo can be installed directly from the livecd using our installer PentooInstaller
 * Pentoo can be installed using overlay OverlayUsage

== Who is behind it ==
