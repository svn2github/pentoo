DEPENDANCIES:
  - GCC and binutils
  - GNU Bash

USAGE:
  See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/genkernel.xml or
  issue ``genkernel --help''.

PORTING:
  To port to other arches:

  # cd /usr/share/genkernel
  # cp -Rp x86 ${myarch}
  # mkdir /usr/share/genkernel/pkg/${myarch}

  Modify what is needed in the /usr/share/genkernel/${myarch}
  directory, as well making a generic kernel-config.

IMPORTANT KERNEL NOTES:
  - You MUST have /dev/pts turned on.
    "Block devices->Loopback device support"  
    "Block devices->RAM disk support"
  - To boot genkernel properly, the kernel config must have
    RAM disk support and Initial RAM disk support. You should
    also set your "Default RAM disk size to 8192"

BOOTING A KERNEL WITH INITRD:

  GRUB:
    real_root=	needs to point to your root partition
    root=	needs to point to the ramdisk (should stay at /dev/ram0)
    init=	needs to point to the linuxrc file to execute on the ramdisk
    vga=	should be the resolution you want your screen. 0x317 is
    		1024x768 - 16bpp and you'll get a pretty splash if
    		configured properly

  GRUB EXAMPLE ENTRY:
    title=2.6.0 [ Genkernel ]
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel (hd0,0)/boot/kernel-2.6.0-gentoo root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc real_root=/dev/hda3 vga=0x317
    initrd (hd0,0)/boot/initrd-2.6.0-gentoo
