# Description:
# Serial cable, IrDA, Bluetooth and USB pppd options for GPRS phones.
# See 'man pppd' for detailed option descriptions.

# Most GPRS phones don't reply to LCP echo's
lcp-echo-failure 0
lcp-echo-interval 0

# Keep pppd attached to the terminal:
# Comment this to get daemon mode pppd
nodetach

# Debug info from pppd:
# Comment this off, if you don't need more info
debug

# Show password in debug messages
show-password

# Connect script:
# scripts to initialize the GPRS modem and start the connection,
# wvdial command is for Orange SPV while other phones should work with chat
connect /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-connect-chat
#connect "/usr/bin/wvdial --chat --config /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-wvdial.conf radiolinja_usb_orange_spv"

# Disconnect script:
# AT commands used to 'hangup' the GPRS connection.
disconnect /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-disconnect-chat

# Serial device to which the GPRS phone is connected:
# /dev/ttyS0 for serial port (COM1 in Windows), 
# /dev/ircomm0 for IrDA,
# /dev/ttyUB0 for Bluetooth (Bluez with rfcomm running) and
# /dev/ttyUSB0 for USB
#/dev/ttyS0	# serial port one
#/dev/ttyS1	# serial port two
#/dev/ircomm0	# IrDA serial port one
#/dev/rfcomm0	# Bluetooth serial port one
#/dev/ttyUSB0	# USB serial device, for example Orange SPV
/dev/ttyACM0	# USB serial device, for example Orange SPV


# Serial port line speed
115200	# fast enough
#57600	# perhaps usefull with IrDA as some phones don't like 
        # speeds higher than this

# Hardware flow control:
# Use hardware flow control with cable, Bluetooth and USB but not with IrDA.
crtscts  # serial cable, Bluetooth and USB, on some occations with IrDA too
#nocrtscts # IrDA

# Ignore carrier detect signal from the modem:
local

# IP addresses:
# - accept peers idea of our local address and set address peer as 10.0.0.1 
# (any address would do, since IPCP gives 0.0.0.0 to it)
# - if you use the 10. network at home or something and pppd rejects it,
# change the address to something else 
:10.1.1.1

# pppd must not propose any IP address to the peer!
noipdefault

# Accept peers idea of our local address
ipcp-accept-local

# Add the ppp interface as default route to the IP routing table
defaultroute

# Newer pppd's also support replacing the default route, if one is 
# already present, when the GPRS connetion should be set as the default route
# to the network
#replacedefaultroute

# DNS servers from the phone:
# some phones support this, some don't.
usepeerdns

# ppp compression:
# ppp compression may be used between the phone and the pppd, but the 
# serial connection is usually not the bottleneck in GPRS, so the 
# compression is useless (and with some phones need to disabled before 
# the LCP negotiations succeed).

nobsdcomp
novjccomp
nopcomp
noaccomp

# The phone is not required to authenticate:
noauth

# Username and password:
# If username and password are required by the APN, put here the username 
# and put the username-password combination to the secrets file: 
# /etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP 
# authentication. See pppd man pages for details.
# Example, Radiolinja operator pap-secrets: 
# "rlnet"         *       "internet"	*
user "internet"

# The persist tries to reopen the connection if it is dropped. This
# is usefull for example with a Nokia 7650 which only manages to
# 'dial' with every second attempt or when the network likes to drop the
# connection every now and then. It's not fun when the over-night 
# 'apt-get dist-upgrade -d -y' fails constantly...
#persist
#maxfail 99

# Asyncmap:
# some phones may require this option.
#asyncmap 0xa0000

# No magic:
# some phones may require this option.
#nomagic

# Require PAP authentication:
# some phones may require this option.
