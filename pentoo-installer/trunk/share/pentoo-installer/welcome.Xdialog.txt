            Welcome to the Pentoo Installation program

  The install process is fairly straightforward, and you should run
  through the options in the order they are presented. If you are
  unfamiliar with partitioning/making filesystems, you may want to
  consult some documentation before continuing.

  You can view all output from commands by switching to tty8:
  alt-f8/alt-f1 from a console
  ctrl+alt+f8/ctrl+alt+f7 from a X terminal
