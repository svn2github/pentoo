To run this program, you need:

>=dev-python/pygtk-2.4 (stable in tree)
sys-apps/parted (1.6.15 is stable, 1.6.20 is ~x86)
dev-python/pyparted (1.6.6 is stable, 1.6.9 is ~x86)

When running this program, you need to do the following:

export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:../.."

You only need to do this once when you open up a new shell, xterm, etc. You
can then run this program normally. Because of the code that reads the existing
partition table, gtkfe.py must be run as root. This isn't an issue during an
install but can be a real pain when coding/testing. I'll try to fix this.
